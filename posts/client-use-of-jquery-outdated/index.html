      <h1 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h1>
<p>The application references code elements that have been declared as deprecated. This could include classes, functions, methods, properties, modules, or obsolete library versions that are either out of date by version, or have been entirely deprecated. It is likely that the code that references the obsolete element was developed before it was declared as obsolete, and in the meantime the referenced code was updated.</p>
<h1 id="risk">Risk</h1>
<p>Referencing deprecated modules can cause an application to be exposed to known vulnerabilities, that have been publicly reported and already fixed. A common attack technique is to scan applications for these known vulnerabilities, and then exploit the application through these deprecated versions. However, even if deprecated code is used in a way that is completely secure, its very use and inclusion in the code base would encourage developers to re-use the deprecated element in the future, potentially leaving the application vulnerable to attack, which is why deprecated code should be eliminated from the code-base as a matter of practice. Note that the actual risk involved depends on the specifics of any known vulnerabilities in older versions.</p>
<h1 id="general-recommendations">General Recommendations</h1>
<h2 id="how-to-avoid-it">How to avoid it</h2>
<ol>
<li>Always prefer to use the most updated versions of libraries, packages, and other dependancies.</li>
<li>Do not use or reference any class, method, function, property, or other element that has been declared deprecated.</li>
</ol>
